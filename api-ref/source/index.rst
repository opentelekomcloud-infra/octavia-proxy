 Octavia API
=============

This is a reference for the OpenStack Load Balancing API which is provided by
the Open Telekom Cloud Octavia-proxy project.

**Supported** API version

   v2/index

Octavia API minor releases are additive to the API major revision and share
the same URL path. Minor revision changes to the API are called out in the API
reference in the section the change occurred in. Subsequent minor versions are a
superset of the previous versions of the same major revision.

The API status reflects the state of the endpoint on the service.

* *Current* indicates a stable version that is up-to-date, recent, and might
  receive future versions. This endpoint should be prioritized over all
  others.
* *Supported* is a stable version that is available on the server. However, it
  is not likely the most recent available and might not be updated or might
  be deprecated at some time in the future.
* *Deprecated* is a stable version that is still available but is being
  deprecated and might be removed in the future.
* *Experimental* is not a stable version. This version is under development or
  contains features that are otherwise subject to change. For more
  information about API status values and version information, see
  `Version Discovery <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VersionDiscovery>`__.
