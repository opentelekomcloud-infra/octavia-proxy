Introduction

This is a list of known SDKs and language bindings that support OpenStack
load balancing via the Octavia API. This list is a "best effort" to keep
updated, so please check with your favorite SDK project to see if they
support OpenStack load balancing. If not, open a bug for them!

.. Note:: The projects listed here may not be maintained by the OpenStack
          LBaaS team. Please submit bugs for these projects through their
          respective bug tracking systems.
